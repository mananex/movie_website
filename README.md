# Film Website

**This project is a parser and website about movies. The parser program takes all the movies from the top 250 movies from IMDB.**
##### From third party libraries I have used the following:
```psycopg2``` **(for postgresql)**

```requests``` **(to send http requests)**

```bs4```      **(for parsing data from html markup)**

**And for the website, I used the Django framework.**

# Installation

**I created a project on Windows, so the commands will be for Windows.**
